# Keeper-App

Hello,

I am Chandrakant Santoshrao joshi. This one is solo project build in 2 days with the help of react, JavaScript, CSS & HTML. 
I used react hooks and functional based components in this project.

The name of the app is keeper app where user can add there task as shown in below img.

Here I used local storage to store the added task. If any task is completed then user can mark through line in Title and Note section as shown in below img.

If user wants to delete the task from list then this functionality is also added in my app. I used Hooks for adding this kind of functionality.

I used flex for making my app responsive. This is all about my keeper app project.

Thanks.
